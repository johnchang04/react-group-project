        <h1> Sizzling Lunch </h1>
        <p> Sizzling Lunch on Telegraph Ave is a great place to watch your food cook in front of you.
        They're a great choice to take your parents when they come for the weekend or just for a dinner with friends. 
        If you want to avoid awkward social interactions with wait staff, this is the place for you. 
            </p>
